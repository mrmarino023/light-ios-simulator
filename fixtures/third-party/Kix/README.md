**This is a test application, created specifically for practicing and demonstrating UI and Unit testing in a SwiftUI environment.**

Kix is a sample e-commerce app for a modern sneaker store. Its primary purpose is to serve as a realistic, hands-on project for writing, running, and maintaining a comprehensive test suite using XCTest. The entire architecture and UI are designed with testability as the top priority.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main goal of this application is to serve as a practical example for:
*   **UI & Unit Testing:** The app is built from the ground up with testability in mind, featuring accessibility identifiers for all interactive elements.
*   **SwiftUI Implementation:** Demonstrates modern SwiftUI patterns for navigation, state management, and building a component-based UI.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Showcases a clean, scalable, and maintainable project structure (MVVM).

## ✨ Features

*   **Full Authentication Flow:** Mock user login and registration screens.
*   **Tab-Based Navigation:** A `TabView` provides access to the main sections of the app:
    *   **Home:** A scrollable list of sneaker products.
    *   **Favorites:** A view to manage the user's favorite items.
    *   **Cart:** A functional shopping cart to add and manage products.
    *   **Notes:** A simple CRUD section for practicing unit tests.
    *   **Menu:** A section for user profile and app settings.
*   **Interactive UI:** Smooth animations and visual feedback on user interactions.
*   **Mock Data Layer:** The app uses a mock data service, ensuring there are no network dependencies. This makes testing fast, reliable, and predictable.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

*   **Framework:** SwiftUI
*   **Language:** Swift
*   **Testing:** XCTest for both UI and Unit Tests.
*   **Architecture:** The project follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** pattern. The code is organized into distinct layers for clarity and separation of concerns:
    *   `App`: The main entry point.
    *   `Core`: Shared components, models, and theme (colors, typography).
    *   `Features`: Individual screens of the app (e.g., Auth, Home, Cart).
    *   `Navigation`: Manages the app's main navigation flow (e.g., TabView).
    *   `Services`: Provides data to the app (e.g., MockDataService).
